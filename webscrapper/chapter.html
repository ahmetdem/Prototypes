<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;As soon as the plume of smoke cleared up, Ram felt a rare sense of helplessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She opened her pale crimson eyes, straining them as she peered into the room which still had smoke hovering over it. However, even as she did so, searching for something amongst the emptiness, the ones which she was seeking were nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked for those people in the room where a large hole had appeared, someone moving, or someone in black, along with the adorable blue one; however, they were nowhere to be found…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">???: [&#8230;Ram!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram’s shoulder was grabbed from behind as she’d tried to take a step forward, bringing her back to her senses. She realised that she’d been about to step through a cracked bit of the floor. If she hadn’t been stopped in her tracks, she might have fallen.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How clumsy of her, to literally not even see what was beneath her feet.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">???: [I’m glad you’re safe Ram… And Patrasche-chan, are you okay as well?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [Emilia&#8230; sama…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram bit her lip. Meanwhile, the one who’d grabbed her by the shoulder was Emilia, who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been on the upper floors. While panting slightly, Emilia checked to make sure Ram was okay, as well as how the black Earth Dragon, Patrasche, who was crouched down behind them, was getting on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, while looking at them, Ram regained enough of her composure to take in the state of her surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The corridor in what should have been a robust stone tower had collapsed, with the floor and ceiling both smashed to pieces. She could see the sky and sand of the sand-sea from across the wall, which now had a hole in it; a parched breeze was blowing in as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the place that had gotten damaged the most was the room where Ram, Patrasche and co. had been staying in until just before ― That’s to say, the room they’d so dubbed the “Green Room”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room had been chock-full of grass and ivy, covering the walls, floor, and even going up all the way to the ceiling. Nevertheless, the room was now unrecognizable from its original state, with its natural erosion of many, many years torn up root and branch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That included its beds, which were woven from grass and ivy, as well as the faint light the Spirit’s presence gave off; all of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That, and their biggest problem was…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [Ram… Where did Subaru and Rem go? They’re safe, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing by Ram’s side, Emilia peered into the area where the Green Room had previously stood. Ram wasn’t able to answer her question straight away, even though she knew that her painful silence itself served as an answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　                    </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">△▼△▼△▼△</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">???: [&#8230;First of all, let’s try ‘n sort out what happened. We’re not gonna be able ta talk about things calmly unless we do tha’.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking around at everyone who’d gathered within the room as she said that, Anastasia took charge of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia’s white fox scarf ― Echidna ― was still wrapped around her. She brushed her fingers through her slightly dusty fur as she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [So, about that black shadow that attacked the tower jus’ before…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius: [It’s gone, at least for now. Thanks to the power of the Divine Dragon, Volcanica, I’d say.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echidna: [Both the Dragon and the shadow’s movements were so sudden, it made us really wonder what the heck was happening, huh.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the tower, the ones who’d come back safe and sound began to share what had happened, starting first with Anastasia, and then Julius and Echidna following her lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like Anastasia and Echidna, Julius’ white knight garb was also covered in grime. However, that wasn&#8217;t just because of the heated battle that had taken place in the tower, it was also heavily due to the effects of the aforementioned event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, none of these three had ended up with any extra injuries; on that point itself, you could say it was a relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That in itself was thanks to the achievement wrought by the Divine Dragon, Volcanica, on the top-most floor of the tower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [Volcanica cleaved the looming shadow with its breath, I suppose. If not for that, we would have probably been in for a world of hurt, in fact.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia gave Beatrice a nod in response to what she’d said, as the latter folded her short arms together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all honesty, when Volcanica had unleashed its breath so suddenly, Anastasia had uncharacteristically resigned herself for death. Things had happened so quickly, that there hadn’t been any way to deal with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though of course she couldn’t say that she’d completely relaxed her guard just because of that single breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius: [The Divine Dragon’s response to the crisis dawning upon us was simply magnificent, but even so, the state it’s in isn’t great, that remains unchanged still… Currently though, it seems to be keeping itself quite obedient and following Emilia-sama’s instructions.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [Out of consideration for Julius, I’mma try ‘n avoid callin’ ‘em “senile”&#8230; But, ‘tis all the same as the Divine Dragon-san bein’ a scary‘un. Anyways, as for what happened, it’s exactly as Beatrice-chan says.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [I suppose.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only one who could have dealt with a situation as abrupt as that was Volcanica. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would have become of them now, had the Dragon not blown away the looming shadow for them.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, they couldn’t start jumping around in joy…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">???: [There was a to~n of ‘em. But, they all went towards Onii-san and stuff…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [Meili-chan.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meili: [&#8230;Ah, my apo~logies.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meili didn’t take care with her word choice, almost as if she were upset, and for that, Anastasia chided her. Meili gave her a sincere apology as she looked towards Ram and Emilia, both having kept their silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hindsight, the ones who’d received the damage from that shadow had been the two from the Emilia Camp ― Subaru and Rem ― Thus, the damage the Anastasia Camp had suffered was practically zilch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [Though it’s not like I can actually say that, we’re all travellin’ together after all.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia muttered that to herself before then catching a glimpse of Julius and Echidna. They had been working together with Emilia’s group during the time she’d traded places with Echidna, when she’d been sleeping at the depths of her own consciousness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It went without saying for Echidna, whom she’d known for around ten years, but even the practically brand spanking new Julius, at least as far as her memories were concerned, could easily tell that she was shook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that point, it was quite the surprise to Anastasia that Beatrice, who should have been quite close to them, had come to this meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [Beatrice-chan, are ya alright? Ah wait, no, it ain’t propa’ of me to use a word like “Alright”. But still, ya haven’ gotten ya’self into a panic, no?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [&#8230;Betty panicking wouldn’t mean it’d bring back Subaru and Rem, in fact. Right now, the main issue in question is messing up our first move due to panic, I suppose. I’d specifically like to avoid that, in fact.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [First move? By that, do you mean…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [&#8230;Bringing back Subaru and Rem. Taking action for that, yeah?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia raised her eyebrows quizzically as she tried to question Beatrice. However Emilia interrupted her, still while supporting Ram by her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia’s amethyst eyes pierced right through Anastasia, her eyes widening in surprise a tad at the intensity of her glare. She wet her lips with her tongue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [Dang, I thought you were gonna be dejected as heck, but that’s one helluva’ look you’ve got in your eyes. What d’ya mean?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [It’s really nothing complicated. Subaru and Rem ended up being swallowed by that shadow and taken away from us… Volcanica did drive it away, but he was just a tad too slow. Even so…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [They didn’t die from it. I’m sure of it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While still being propped up by Emilia, Ram opened her eyes and replied. Then she gently touched the part of her on her forehead ― the part where presumably her Oni Clan Horn had been ― as she let out an exhausted sigh. It was what served as the basis of her words, which felt full of conviction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [The Oni Tribe’s… Ah, wouldn’t that be the sisters’ synesthesia? So you’re saying that you’re linked with Rem-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [Yep, that’s right. Rem is alive… No clue about Barusu.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [Subaru’s alright as well, I suppose! Betty can guarantee that, in fact!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice shouted in anger, almost red in the face, in response to Ram’s very Ram-like words. After all, she was Beatrice, the Spirit who’d made a contract with Subaru. Her words did have some credibility to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, it meant that the two of them who had vanished had been confirmed to be alive from separate angles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius: [In regards to Subaru, we have his connection with Beatrice-sama’s contract, and in regards to Miss Rem, we have Miss Ram’s synesthesia… Both of those are worth believing in. Besides, I too would like to hope.]  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [Quite the honesty there… Well, either way, I too would rather prefer that Natsuki-kun ‘n Rem-san were safe ‘n sound.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia stroked her scarf after Julius replied, as if to say getting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">too </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">close to them would be a problem.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were working with Emilia’s group as collaborators for the time being ― But the fact that they were competing with each other in the Royal Selection hadn’t changed. She didn’t want them to get the wrong idea about that and add to their troubles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, it was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">precisely </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">because they were fighting each other that they ought to repay their debts without fail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meili: [We~ll then? Like, it’s super-duper good that Onii-san ‘n stuff are alive, bu~t, where are they?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failing to read the mood positively, Meili asked them that while playing around with the Tiny Crimson Scorpion balanced on her head. Julius opened his mouth in reaction to her question, and began to speak,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius: [Well, though I wouldn’t be able to explain them in great detail, that shadow was the product of Yin Magic… Or at the very least, the Yin Attribute. It should be the same sort that’s sealing the likes of the Witch of Envy in her shrine, and Roy Alphard in the Dragon Carriage. If we presume this to be the case, then as for our resident expert…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [&#8230;That would be Betty, I suppose. My prognosis isn’t all that different from Julius’ either, in fact. That </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a clump of Yin, I suppose. It’s close to a Shamak that’s been given direction, in fact.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echidna: [Shamak? Isn’t that the basic magic of the Yin Attribute? How was it then so powerful?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [&#8230;I knew there was going to be quite a few </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">humans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who’d misunderstand since there are hardly any users of it. However, it’s troubling that even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">think of it like that, when you’re a Spirit like me, in fact.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echidna, who had taken up her white-fox form, was stared at reproachfully by Beatrice, causing her to cower her head. Giving a sigh at her reaction, Beatrice raised one of her fingers and said: “May I, I suppose?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [Shamak’s special quality is in “Separation”, in fact. A low-grade Shamak separates one’s body from their awareness, whereas a high-grade Shamak rends space from itself, I suppose. Betty’s Door Crossing is one such application, linking two rooms together, and achieving something close to teleportation, in fact.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [That was the contraption Beatrice-sama had set up in the previous mansion. It was a real pain having to call her for mealtimes, so to be quite honest, I’d gotten fed up with it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [It really upsets Betty that you’d say that so honestly right here, right now, I suppose. I do believe I am sorry about it, but the apologies can wait until later… Anyways, Shamak, in essence, can separate space from space if so inclined; as well as that, it can separate objects, no matter how strong they are. It’s the Witch of Envy’s speciality, in fact.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [From your explanation, aren’t you saying that Natsuki-kun and Rem-san have been scattered into pieces?]</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that shadow was as deadly as that, then what she’d said felt just like something that branded Subaru and Rem’s survival, who’d been swallowed by it, as being hopeless. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice however shook her head at Anastasia’s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [What I mentioned right now was an allegory, I suppose. At least, that shadow wasn’t something that was set to chop Subaru and Rem into pieces, in fact. But it was going to take them within and whisk them away somewhere, I suppose.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echidna: [Somewhere… Across space… In this situation, I imagine it would be to where she is?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [&#8230;After all, there’s the matter of Barusu’s miasma.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echidna broke down Beatrice’s exposition into simpler terms, and at the end of that, Ram provided the reason why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The miasma that enveloped Subaru, which had greatly agitated the Witchbeasts en-route to the Watchtower, was now a well-known fact amongst the Royal Selection Candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding this miasma thing, both its cause, and its finer details, were unknowns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [All I know about the miasma is that it attracts Witchbeasts to it, and that the people who are connected with the Witch Cult often emanate it in spades… That’s pretty much it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [Hm, although Subaru’s been chased by Witchbeasts quite a few times, he’s got nothing to do with the Witch Cult. I get that it’s preeeeetty suspicious, but…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [No need ta fret, don’ worry, I ain’t castin’ doubt on that now, Emilia-san.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [Oh? Thank goodness. Subaru is a good boy, so…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia patted her chest in relief, however, the issue was still very much there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Anastasia had said, the thread of thought regarding Subaru being connected to the Witch Cult was no longer inside her. Nevertheless, the fact that they didn’t know Subaru’s origins still brought forth doubts within her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t think that Subaru was someone with ill intent. However, ill intent that one wasn’t conscious to was a thing too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a chance that, behind all of his good intent, Subaru&#8217;s existence was a ticking time-bomb in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [Yeah Yeah, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so your concern is unnecessary, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got that much from how ya started the sentence off. The shadow that swallowed Natsuki-kun and Rem-san up was the one that whisked ‘em away ta somewhere. The real question is, where ta?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echidna: [As well as what happened due to Volcanica’s breath having interfered with it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice and Ram, who were linked with the two of Subaru and Rem respectively, probably had a rough idea of their whereabouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Searching for them was going to be a tall order, if all they knew was that they were alive, without knowing exactly where they’d been hurtled off to. ――At the very least, the option of not searching for them was not available to anyone in this place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [Please, you two, where are Subaru and Rem? Tell me please.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice and Ram exchanged looks, having turned towards Emilia’s sincere appeal. Then after a few seconds of silence from the both of them…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [&#8230;He’s south, in fact.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [Ram too senses that she’s in that same direction. I’m not sure of her exact position, but I think she’s fairly far away.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [South? South from here we have the uhh….]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia furrowed her well-defined eyebrows straight after Beatrice and Ram had both mentioned they were south. Though she must have been giving it her all to envision the map of the world in her mind, Anastasia raised her hand in her stead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently they were in the Augria Sand Dunes situated in the easternmost part of the world map. As far as south from here went, Picoutatte or Flanders, of the five great cities, were the most likely, however…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius: [In regards to that alone, the state of the two is inscrutable.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly having arrived at the same idea, Julius spoke Anastasia’s mind for her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the way he got into sync with the speed of her thoughts, Anastasia valued him as being ideal as her knight even more, all while batting one of her eyes shut and saying: “Indeed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [‘Tis quite the distance, but if they find themselves aroun’ those parts, then we can say that the damage incurred would be negligible. Yet, despite that, both of yer faces look pale… Do ya both mean ta say he’s way more south?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [Way more south, you can’t mean…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meili: [&#8230;They ended up going all the way down to the Vollachian Empire in the sou~th?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meili’s surprise was minimal compared to how shocked Emilia was. But it was safe to say that Meili’s reaction was down to the fact that she hadn’t comprehended the scale of things. Given that, Beatrice and the others’ reactions were all perfectly understandable.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru and Rem had crossed through the country… And </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they’d crossed into the Southern Empire, they had a real problem at hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [If I’m not mistaken… The Kingdom of Lugunica ‘n the Vollachian Empire in the south signed a nonaggression pact that would last for the entire Royal Selection. Isn’ that right, Julius?] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius: [That’s correct. I imagine you wouldn’t know about this, but I also went there to tie down the agreement. Me, Reinhardt, Felis and such met the Emperor in person.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [From what I’d heard, we were on reaaaally bad terms with the Empire; but, if you did that, then are we okay with them now? So if we were to go and search for Subaru and Rem…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius: [&#8230;No, that’s not going to fly.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius lowered his brows with a shake of his head in response to Emilia’s timid question. He softly cast his yellow eyes down, which glittered like jewels, emblazoned on his handsome features,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius: [The Empire has forbidden travel between itself and the Kingdom since several months ago, for the time being. Due to the Royal Selection, the same thing happened with the Holy Kingdom of Gusteko in the north, however they’ve already rescinded their ban…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echidna: [I guess that means the one the Empire set hasn’t been rescinded. Though we did travel to the Watchtower, so because of that we don’t have the latest information… So if the situation there hasn’t changed&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [Going there to help Subaru and Rem is going to be tough?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius: [Yes, unfortunately.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though they exchanged various thoughts about it, Julius concluded with these mere words of regret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia too, could only come to the same conclusion as Julius. It would be impossible to break in from the front where entering the Vollachian Empire was concerned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’d have no choice but to look for a secret way in, and in addition to that, they’d also need to find the time and contacts for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;d be no quick and easy way here. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely Emilia would be in an absolute hurry when thinking about the two people who’s status remained unknown…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [&#8230;We need to move quickly. We’ll receive Volcanica’s blood and bring it back to Pristella… Then we’ll take the Gluttony we captured to the Royal Capital, yeah?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [Emilia…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [I know Beatrice. I can’t help but feel reaaally, reaaally impatient. But we won’t be able to help Subaru and Rem out, even if we rush things here… We’ve gotta remain calm.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Emilia’s calm decision surprised Anastasia, just as it seemed she would have gotten into a panic. She gave a resolute nod at Beatrice, also similarly surprised. Her eyes were quivering, her voice was shaking a bit, yet she was giving it her all to keep a grip of herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was just like she was saying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not going to fold my arms together and sit back for even a second, if it means getting Subaru and Rem back.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [You two, Subaru and Rem must be together, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [&#8230;I just double-checked with Beatrice-sama, we think they probably are.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [Alrighty… Then if that’s the case, I’m sure Subaru will go to great lengths to protect Rem. That’s why we needn’t worry about Rem. Even though Subaru’s a lil’ scary.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though her belief in Subaru was strong, in regards to the same kind of worries, Anastasia did agree as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natsuki Subaru had lost his memories for a bit in the tower, as a result of being left to his own devices. That boy with a propensity for self-punishment had a bad habit of making light of himself in order to protect the people precious to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as it sometimes would encourage others, it also similarly served as a cause for concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [That said, guess all we can really do is count on Natsuki-kun’s quick wits. Emilia-san is right, what we can’t do is stay here grumblin’ ‘n moanin’ inside the tower. We gotta get a move on.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julius: [Understood loud and clear… Beatrice-sama, do inform us if there are any elements of concern.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beatrice: [&#8230;Subaru’s body, I suppose. Subaru’s gate can’t expel mana out on its own since it’s broken, in fact. If we leave him alone for too long, then it’s going to burst due to a mana blockage, I suppose.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [I see. I’m sorta in the same boat, so I can really get on the same level as Natsuki-kun there.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia’s gate was defective by birth. She was unable to take in mana properly; such, for example, would be a critical defect for a mage. Nevertheless, this had no effect on the luck and knack for business needed for a merchant, so it didn’t really bother her much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echidna: [Ana…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia: [I know, I know. In regards to our problems, ain’t we gonna talk about ‘em separately a bit later&#8230; That aside, it doesn’ look like we’ve got any time ta slack off.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia clapped her hands together, with everyone else nodding back at her signal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their objective was to search for the whereabouts of Subaru and Rem, who’d both disappeared. For that, they would need to return from the Pleiades Watchtower as soon as possible, in order to muster a search party as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, they needed to fulfill one of the primary objectives that they’d come to the tower for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meili: [Things are so hectic, to the point that I almost feel like I’m gonna pass ou~t…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [I know right. Still, Subaru and Rem must be having it way more tough.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia firmly clenched her fist, thinking of Subaru, who’d been hurtled off to somewhere faraway. Seeing her face in profile, Meili, with the Tiny Crimson Scorpion plopped on her head, narrowed her eyes and said “Yeah, of course” with a shrug of her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just like that, the group began to busy themselves to get their preparations done ― Or so, they were about to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meili: [Come to thi~nk of it, Ram Onee-san, did you tell ‘em about th~at thing?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [&#8230; I still haven’t.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia and the others: [&#8230;? That thing?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram’s face turned sour at Meili’s rather abrupt question. All of their gazes turned towards Ram, clearly having not heard anything about it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With them all looking at her, Ram paused for a brief moment, and after that said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ram: [Emilia-sama, although I’m still not one-hundred percent sure about this… The ones  swallowed by the shadow and hurtled away to the Empire may not just be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barusu and Rem.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [Not only the two of them… But you, Patrasche-chan, and Meili are all accounted for, so shouldn’t that be everyone who was in the Green Room?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meili: [Well, a girl appeared all of a sudden, before that shadow came kinda kerplowing i~n. And what’s more, according to Oniisan, it was the third Gluttony or some~thing.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia and the others: [The third Gluttony!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anastasia and the others were taken completely aback after being told this tidbit they really could not disregard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, the discussion grew in intensity, regarding whether they should amend their actions going forward and getting the details which Ram had kept under wraps regarding this matter out of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As that went on, within the now turned bedlam of the Pleiades Watchtower, Emilia clasped her hands in prayer in front of her chest, all the while looking out of the huge hole where the Green Room had once stood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emilia: [Please, Subaru… I really hope you’ll be alright with Rem.] </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">△▼△▼△▼△</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">――As Emilia’s small prayer drowned in the parched skies overhead the sea of sand, at the same time far, far away,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [―――― ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting atop an open meadow, caressed gently by a wandering breeze was a boy, and in his embrace, a girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boy had black hair, and his eyes sharp as the edge of a dagger, with the whites being quite pronounced, ala the very known sanpakugan; eyes that made his face to appear in a permanent scowl, a glare rumored to be all that is needed to kill a man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, at that moment, his lips curved up ever so softly, and the corners of those eyes were wet. It took all he had to not break into a complete bawl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a natural outcome, of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d waited for this very moment for so long. The memories of each day he passed in wait, in grief, none would allow him to look away for even the briefest of moments from the girl in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl, embraced so dearly, looked at him through the locks of her bright, blue hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes widened, though the strength to resist was barely present on her adorable face. It was as if she had woken from sleep, and was still caught up in her drowsiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, that was indeed the truth of the matter. She’d finally woken up from a long, long slumber, so she’d quite obviously feel a disconnect from reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [……Ah… um&#8230; ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her lips moved, as if mulling over what he’d spoken of moments ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he watched, the boy――Natsuki Subaru nodded vigorously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru:  [Yeah, exactly, that’s exactly it, Rem. I’m your Hero. I’ve been waiting for so long for&#8230; ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [―――― ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Rem? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to stifle the tremble of his own voice, he desperately tried to pick up on Rem’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps due to being thirsty or something of the sort, though as her lips moved and her tongue flicked, her throat would not produce sound. Even so, he put his ear near her mouth, attempting to glean even a sliver of what Rem was trying to communicate to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her meagre attempts to convey anything filled him with immense joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [&#8230;m. ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [I’m listening, there’s no need to rush it, okay? Rem, what are you trying to&#8230; ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell me, as he would’ve said, but was ultimately cut off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once he’d drawn his ears close enough to listen to her, his trail of thought was halted as a hand pushed against his head and chin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following that flow, he felt himself be turned over and fall to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [……Re&#8230;Rem? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru found himself with his back on the grass, and Rem straddled on top of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bewildered, he remained stiff in place. Staring down at him, Rem’s eyes scanned him from top to bottom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then released a quiet sigh and,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [What’s your aim here? Tell me what you intend to do to me right now! ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [―――― ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [Calling yourself some Hero out of the blue and&#8230;… Who’s Rem? Tell me right now! ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knees pressed down over Subaru’s shoulders, her hands shot to his neck. With her weight bearing down on him, Subaru struggled to move, his legs twitching restlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the skill with which Rem had restrained him was somewhat aweing. She’d left no room for him to regain his freedom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Gu… ah… ghk…… ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [If you refuse to speak, I will simply continue until you desire to do so. Please do not prolong your own suffering. Speak. What exactly are you&#8230; ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [――Gha. ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew not whether it was involuntary or on purpose, but the strength with which Rem used to press against his neck left him no room to answer her with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As his mind dimmed due to the lack of oxygen, he realized letting this go on would result in his death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had been so long, and even if it were a one-sided reunion, Subaru could allow it to end with Rem strangling him. Not like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if nothing of Subaru remains in her memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [A- Ah…… ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [Are you feeling like speaking now? If so, I will, in good faith―― ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, as Rem frowned while looking at the signs of strained struggle on his face,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louis: [Ah-! Ooh-! ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [――Kya-!? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, a petite shadow slammed into Rem’s body from the side―― Or rather, it leapt onto Rem and became entangled with her on the grass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the weight gone, he rolled over and began coughing, then looked towards Rem with clouded, wet eyes. There, he saw the figure of a little girl struggling with Rem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louis: [Uuuー! Uuuuー! ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [W-what are you doing… Stop it, please! This isn’t the time to be&#8230; ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her blonde hair covering all of Rem, the little girl bared her teeth on her flushed red face as she howled. Subaru stopped, unable to form any thoughts upon witnessing this sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru took a breath and rushed to the two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Oi! Get away from Rem, right now! ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louis: [Ahー, Uuuー!! ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru pushed off the little girl who had been trying to pull on Rem’s hair――Archbishop Louis Arneb, and held her down with her hands behind her back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The light bodied『Gluttony』attempted to struggle, but only in vain. The best she could currently do was kick about. Twists and groans were thrown in, but nothing more beyond that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louis: [Auー! Uuuー, Uuuuー!! ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [God damnit, you……! Stop struggling……Just stay put! Rem, are you okay!? Did she do anything to you!? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [N-no, I’m fine. More than that, I keep asking you over and over&#8230; ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru yelled as he held Louis down, to which Rem answered with crooked brows. With her eyes fixed on him, she attempted to stand on her feet――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [――Eh? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And thumped back onto the ground, her knees having given away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her strange way of falling down raised questions in Subaru’s mind. Yet unaware she was being observed, she pushed on her knees and tried to stand up once more. However――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [……My legs won’t&#8230; ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Wait, you can’t stand up? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [N..no, that’s not… Not true… It’s not true at all&#8230; ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her voice trembled as she attempted to refute his strong claim. However, no amount of willpower allowed her to stand up. Far from being able to balance herself, she couldn’t even put any power into her feet at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Are you feeling weak because you’ve been asleep for so long? Wait, that can’t be right. Wouldn’t call the strength you used to push me over just now that of someone who’s been bedridden as long as you. ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was often talk of how one would eventually grow weaker over their long stay at the hospital, likely due to a lack of exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was quite a well-known fact that those people require rehabilitation to stand and walk again, but would that truly end at the legs?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t as if Rem had been moving her upper body during her ‘hospitalization period’. She’d been asleep for over a year, so it would only make sense for her to feel weak overall, and not just in her legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, this disconnect existed in her, in Rem’s body. Likely, this was due to――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [――Wait, could it be because of the feedback she took from Nee-sama’s fight? ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As his mind sifted through the possible reasons as to why Rem’s body would behave like this, that was the conclusion he had reached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d heard from Ram in the『Green Room』about how her death-battle against『Gluttony』went down. Due to Subaru’s worsening condition, Ram needed to change things to avoid being cornered. So she’d chosen to share her ‘burden’ with Rem as her trump card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the majority of Ram’s burden of pain, who was said to be the strongest of the Oni Clan, flowed into Rem. Subaru remembered having that conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that were the case, then――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [……It’s all my fault. ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d uttered a phrase he’d surely be rebuked by Ram for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as it stood, Subaru had been unable to fulfil the duty he himself had taken on himself, resulting in Ram needing to push herself further, which consequently affected Rem. It all went back to being Subaru’s fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steeped in this situation, having none of his friends around that he could rely on, where only he, Rem, and Louis, who was continuing to act weird for god knows what reason, the responsibility he bore was all the more heavy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [All your fault you say… Did you do something to me!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Not at all, it was just a figure of speech; however…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [First things first! Who are you!? And who am I!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving the legs that wouldn’t obey her will properly a firm whack, Rem glared at Subaru with a tempest of fury in her eyes. Subaru felt something rather bitter, that his unpleasant guess had become reality, hearing Rem’s heartbreaking complaint, which had felt like she was going to lose her temper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Rem had said: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who am I”?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who are you” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was still way better. However, her asking about who she was, was still something extremely gut-wrenching for Subaru, considering he’d been waiting so long to see Rem again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d had an inkling this would be the case, from the fact that she was referring to herself using “I” instead of “Rem”. [1]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [I guess she must be in the same state as Crusch-san…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem had had her name and memories taken away from her, resulting in her continued slumber. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were two other patterns found in the victims of Gluttony; namely, the ones found with Julius, who’d had his name taken away from him, thus forgotten by the people around him, as well as with Crusch, who’d had her memories taken away, having lost herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Rem had woken up, she’d done so having lost her own memories; in an amnesiac state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her confusion was perfectly natural when you considered she was stuck in a situation </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">this </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">incomprehensible, along with a boy with mean-looking eyes to him, a girl who could do nothing but groan and her own legs not working as she wished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louis: [Uwaa!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without even realising that Louis had grown quiet, as if she’d tired herself out from struggling around, she dropped from the exhausted Subaru’s arms, and fell down on her backside, letting out a screech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She began to roll about, while rubbing her backside. Subaru didn’t bother to give her any attention, instead he slowly made his way over to Rem’s side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Subaru drew closer to her, Rem kept an eye on him, all the while keeping her guard up strongly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that look in her eyes, he was reminded of the first time Rem had turned this hostility against him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was easy to forget, because they’d gotten quite close after they’d warmed up to each other, but Rem originally was quite reserved, and was a rather difficult girl to get close enough to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that respect, it was way easier with Ram, since she never changed how she interacted with him, both before and after they became closer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scary part in fact though, was that according to one theory, there was even the chance that they didn’t get along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Anyways, the matter of nee-sama aside… Hey, you know…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [W-What is it? Just so you know, if you’re planning on doing anything to me, I’ll…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8230;Rem.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [Huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem’s tense expression turned into one of being taken by surprise. Subaru stopped in his tracks as he made his way over, keeping enough distance between them, so he’d be more than a step out of her reach,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [It’s Rem. That’s your name.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, he called out her name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem sunk into silence, unable to hide her bewilderment, having had that gently poured against her. Nevertheless, she shifted her red tongue, which was barely visible behind her lips, and repeated “Rem” as if making sure of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like she was making herself familiar with her own name anew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [In all honesty, I don’t really know properly what happened either. Just that we got separated from our friends, and we’re here, in this place which is god knows where. You should be able to understand that’s quite the mess, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [Well, I…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While still very bewildered, Rem’s eyes examined the grassland in their surroundings rather than Subaru.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breeze rustled through the grassland, the sun was high up in the sky, and he felt humidity against his skin. A muggy sensation that felt different to the parched air of the Augria Sand Dunes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was in a place that was so different that the sensation he felt from the air had changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [We can’t expect to be helped immediately. We’re gonna need to take the necessary actions to help ourselves from here, somehow or other. That’s why…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [That’s why what? What are you going to tell me to do? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and my legs which can hardly move and all.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8230;I imagine you’ll get all suspicious again once I say this sort of stuff, but I’d be just content with you being here for me. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breathing, talking to me, looking around the surroundings with your eyes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; I’d be content with only that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [&#8230;? You mean looking around with my eyes, and telling you whether the coast is clear?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [No quite like that, though, that too would be fine.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was very much just content with Rem waking up, breathing, and speaking to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was something rather unselfish, what Subaru had implored in regards to Rem having woken up, was only that she’d be in good health, thus these were, no word of exaggeration, his true intentions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, he needed to solve the issue of her missing memories. That, and Emilia, Beatrice, Ram and everyone who’d been left behind in the tower with the matter of Subaru and his group having gotten separated from them, ought to be quite worried. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wanted to join up with them as quickly as possible. ――He wanted to get Ram to meet Rem, since she’d felt such love for her little sister, whom she didn’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Please, won’t you trust me here? Even if I were to give up my life in exchange… No, it means squat were I to give up my life, so I shall protect you at all cost. I swear it. That’s why&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [――. And say I take you up on your offer, then what will you do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Ah, right. Would be pointless to act with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no-plan</span>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so when it comes to one…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receiving Rem’s prudent question, Subaru sought for the information needed to draw up a plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As aforementioned, Subaru and the others were in a vast grassland, however, they could see large trees growing close to each other, encircling the grassland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing they were intercepted by the canopies of the trees before they reached the horizon, the trees surrounding them at a 360 degree angle, it seemed like they were in an open grassland, a place such as that inside of a forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truthfully, it was nothing but dangerous to venture into a forest on a land he was completely unfamiliar with, but――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Firstly, the unbreakable rule when one gets lost in a forest is to let his allies know his location, using a </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GPS</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but……]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [“Gee-pee-es”?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [I know. Nothing like that exists…… It’s just that Beako has the connection she has with me, so there’s a possibility she could pinpoint my whereabouts with something similar. In a way,  you could say my existence itself is a </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GPS</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the situation, there was also the possibility that Ram’s Synesthesia would detect Rem’s location. In that sense, both Subaru and Rem were fulfilling their roles as a GPS that connected them to their allies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [What’s left is securing a source of water…&#8230;. It’s important to get a hold of water, no matter what. It’s probably better if we chose our base camp, and start widening our field of search from there. Edible grass and fruits are…… ahh, I was right to learn it from Clind-san. Gotta thank my mentor…&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the process in which he learned parkour and how to handle a whip, Clind had hammered various techniques and knowledge into his head. There were times he nearly whined about giving up on the teachings of the versatile steward, but thanks to it being beneficial to him, Subaru could keep his guiding principle with him despite being in this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [There’s a lot of other stuff as well, but it’s not like I’m trying to take action without a plan. Are you able to understand now?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [&#8230;&#8230;To an extent. Even if I wanted to resist, I’m in this condition, so……]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8230;&#8230;That’s a remark that I can get a glimpse of your honest thoughts from.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru tested a smile, trying to reassure her, but her reaction wasn’t as good as he thought it would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having lost her “memories”, there was no foundation for Rem to build her trust for Subaru on. If she could move her legs freely, then she might’ve already escaped from him long ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, he didn’t want to think of the misfortune that happened to her as something fortunate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Your legs. I hope you can start moving around on them soon.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [――hk, even if you told me that, I don’t know. What are you going to do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [I told you. Firstly, I’m planning on searching for water. There’s the thing with your legs, so I’m thankful if you wouldn’t act against me if you could……]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying that, Subaru closed the final step between him and Rem, crouching down and turning his back to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she looked at his posture, even Rem would know what he was trying to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [Are you planning to bring me with you on your back?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [There’s also the choice to princess carry you, but I won’t last very long if I do that. If you would let me carry you on my back, I guess it’s very helpful, personally.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [――――]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She fell silent for a while, staring at Subaru’s pitiful expression. After that, she slowly blew out a sigh, and tentatively reached for his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem’s slender arms slunk above his shoulders, interlocking in front of his chest. Feeling the tender weight on his back, Subaru took his time in standing up, making sure he wouldn’t shake Rem, who was clinging onto him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He felt her weight. However, what he thought while carrying her on his back was that she was light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this one year, he had many opportunities to carry the slumbering Rem, but every time he did, he experienced how difficult it was to carry an unconscious person firsthand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sensation wasn’t there with the Rem who was holding onto him of her own accord.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [――? Is something the matter?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [No, it’s just that it was deeply moving, oddly enough. So, it’s about the search for water, but,]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [Before that…… what will we do about that girl?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8230;&#8230;Ah.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead of the place where Rem indicated by jerking her chin over his shoulder, Subaru remembered the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the grassland, splayed out on the grass while patting her bottom, the area she had hit on the ground, was Louis, who was tangled up in her own long, blond hair. ――What should he do about this Sin Archbishop that was acting strangely?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [――――]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Subaru knew Louis’s current state was unnatural.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was an opponent with a mental structure that couldn’t be declared as decent, but it was because of her knavishness, not because he could see her previously hidden side of infantile regression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, she was quite intelligent for her age, and she also had the room to ponder over her devilish thoughts, something that was similar to swiping her tongue across the splinters in one’s heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about the behavior of the current Louis?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louis: [Aah, aauuh―]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having been licking Subaru’s face at the time he woke up, growling like a toddler that didn’t know how to speak, and throwing a tantrum like an infant as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no mistake that something immeasurable had occurred within her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Will that become a reason for me to pity her?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was abhorrently evil. That truth would always be unwavering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louis, who he had faced at the last scene in the “Hall of Memories”, had been traumatized from experiencing “Return by Death”, becoming frightened of not only Subaru, but everything that existed in this world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that point, she had already become enough of a poor, miserable girl. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Subaru didn’t save her. He didn’t even think about wanting to save her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite having many different options held in front of them, they continuously picked the choices that went against humanity, ultimately losing the opportunity to correct those, and cut off their own way out of it. The Sin Archbishops were those kinds of people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her two older brothers, as well as Louis herself, weren’t exceptions, either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committing unforgivable evils, Louis Arneb had turned into a degenerate deserving of being damned to hell. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">――Why did Subaru have to save someone like that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [You won’t help her?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8230;&#8230;It’s complicated. I was in the same place as her, but she’s not really my ally. In fact, she’s on the opposite side of an ally. My heart won’t ache, even if I left her here.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [――――]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind him, he heard Rem’s breath catching in her throat, but it was a reaction that couldn’t be helped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Rem, who didn’t know of Subaru’s circumstances, Louis probably only appeared to her as a young, helpless girl, just as what she looked like. Even if her true identity was one of the desecrators that toyed with a great number of lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Subaru had one choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [We’re leaving her there…… We can’t bring a dangerous element with us, much less a burden.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking up Louis from the advancing shadows was an error of misjudgement that he made in the tower. Perhaps, if Subaru had abandoned her then and there, there could’ve been the possibility this wouldn’t have happened between him and Rem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was certainly what people called it as causing a hundred problems and bringing forth not a single profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [Is…… that so.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Yeah, that’s right. I can’t say I had a pleasant time waking up either, but……]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru’s topmost priority was Rem, and then himself. He would never be confused about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that intention, Subaru ignored Louis, who was lying down on the grass, and headed towards the forest on the opposite side to――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [――As I thought, even if I were to be empty, I was right to believe in myself.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was said with a terribly icy, cutting tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having that voice murmured by his ear close by, Subaru released a breath with an, “Eh?”. However, forbidding him from reacting any further, a pair of slender arms snaked themselves around his neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">――Rem, who was being carried on Subaru’s back, was strangling him from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [――Gahk,]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [Saying things that sound pleasant to my ears before inviting me to come with you, and then abandoning the girl. How could I believe someone like that, telling me to put my trust in him? Stop messing around with me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength in the arms wrapped around his neck was certainly the strength of an oni, unlike her physically handicapped legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to peel her arms away, Subaru’s breathing was blocked completely. Bending himself backwards, he wasn’t aiming to do so, but he fell onto the grassland on his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in spite of being crushed underneath him, Rem refused to remove her arms from his neck. Since she was behind him, he couldn’t flail his arms to free himself from her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The doubts and questions filled up the inside of his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He shouldn’t be asking “Why?”, because Rem had already provided the answer to that. In front of her, who didn’t know anything, Subaru had made too much haste out of his panicking feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was receiving retribution for that, like this――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rem: [Letting such a wicked stench drift around yourself, and saying you’re not scheming anything is a bare-faced lie in itself!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [――――]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wicked stench. Subaru recalled his memories as he heard that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the time he had just gotten to meet Rem, the biggest reason she doubted him and regarded him as dangerous, was by no means the bad impression he gave during their first meeting, nor the shape of the eyes he was born with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">――The Witch’s miasma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having lost her “memories”, even if Rem didn’t have anything left other than herself, she was still able to perceive it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the largest factor that bought him Rem’s suspicions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was too late in remembering it, much less even noticing it, and――,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [――ah,]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thrashing and twisting his body around, Subaru attempted to make an excuse for his actions, but it was impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like that, Subaru’s consciousness fell into the deep abyss of the darkness, slowly and gradually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last thing he wanted was to be killed by Rem like this. He shouted that out with desperation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His voice was silent, unable to be heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　△▼△▼△▼△</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8211;~hk, Rem!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The abrupt awakening of his consciousness, woke up Subaru&#8217;s upper body as though crashing into him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that instant, coughing violently due to the pouncing ache of his throat, whilst spitting out the phlegm stuck there, Subaru somehow raised his body and looked around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location was the meadow Subaru had been thrown into; those were his circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he was in a state of awakening he had remembrance of, he immediately discerned that this spectacle was not one yielded by &#8220;Return by Death&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;Because, neither Rem&#8217;s form nor Louis&#8217; form were to be found anywhere in his environs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [This place&#8230;&#8230; is undoubtedly, someplace I was hurled to. I&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recalling the preceding moments, the instant he touched his neck, the pain regurgitated repulsive memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His throat strangled by Rem whom he was carrying, and just like that, he was robbed of his life. &#8211;No, that was not the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [My throat, hurts&#8230;&#8230; that means, Rem didn&#8217;t kill me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She did strangle him, but did not go as far as to kill him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Astonished by the judgement of Rem, who’d spoken with such an icy voice, Subaru spilled an exhale of relief and then immediately admonished himself that this was no time to be taking relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did not die. In other words, the world was resuming onward from the earlier worst possible turn of events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had Rem doubt his humanity due to the scent of the Witch, and she had disappeared with the worst possible impression of him maintained. &#8211;The reason why those two were not here must be because they sought to run away from Subaru.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Rem was repulsed by Subaru&#8217;s judgement of seeking to leave Louis behind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casting aside a young child in an unknown meadow, he must have seemed as a truly cold-hearted man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [I&#8217;m telling you that&#8217;s a misunderstanding, though she probably won&#8217;t trust me even if I tell her&#8230;&#8230;!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst lamenting his consecutive misjudgements, Subaru straightened his cheeks and stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon looking at the sky, he could tell from the position of the sun that not much time had passed. He did not wish to call this as good fortune, but Rem&#8217;s legs were not in a condition wherein they were at complete liberty either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her legs in that condition, she shan&#8217;t be able to run too far off. It’s proof&#8211;,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [There are drag marks on the grass&#8230;&#8230;! Now I can run after them!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should he pursue the two who ran into the forest spread wide in 360 degrees around him without any clues, then that would mark the beginning of a game of tag with an impossible level of difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, should he follow the traces left on the grass then he would be able to grasp where those two entered the forest from. Though being able to further pursue them from there was the gamble,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [When it comes to unfavorable gambles, I&#8217;ve taken them on for innumerable times!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shouting what was unbefitting of commendation, Subaru fiercely pursued the traces on the grass. With his feet&#8217;s ability, Subaru was able to immediately discern the position the two entered the forest from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With exuberant foliage and trees, it somewhat matched Subaru&#8217;s impression of tropical rainforests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For an instant he was reminded of watching information on the television that the Amazon Forest meant the point of death for humans as a matter of course&#8211;,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [If Rem has entered into such a place, then that&#8217;s all the more reason for me to not overlook it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Subaru and Rem were here in a completely unprepared state for entering a forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he thought of Rem, who had escaped into the forest with impaired legs in desperation, he regretted why he did something so foolish, and cursed every single bit of his judgements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8211;Rem! Come out! Please! I was the one at fault!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the forest, whilst walking over the soft ground and tall grass, Subaru called with a loud voice. Of course, it was possible that his voice would in turn buy Rem and the other&#8217;s anxiety, and make them keep their distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But still, it was far better than wandering around aimlessly in the forest, possessing no clues, possessing nothing to rely on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Above all, he must undertake action he deemed as searching for Rem, or it felt like his chest would burst apart due to guilt and self-hatred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though so many people made so many efforts for the sake of Rem, should something happen to her, just what would he be able to do in order to apologize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was not even possible for him to apologize by giving up on his life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Rem&#8211;! Where are you! Please respond! Please, don&#8217;t leave my side!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking that he would not mind even should his voice run dry, within the obstructive trees of the dense jungle, he raised his voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And his limbs, as he passed through the forest, felt heavy accompanied with tremendous exhaustion. Now that he thought about it, Subaru&#8217;s body had overcome the fierce skirmishes that occured in Pleiades Watchtower, and had gotten only a few hours of sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if his recovery was augmented by the healing of the spirit of the &#8220;Green Room&#8221;, it was bound to eventually fail him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should he be untactful, then he may collapse out of relief upon finding Rem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His guard up against that absurd possibility, Subaru aimlessly walked through the forest&#8211;,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Rem! Please respo~nd! I beg you, I&#8217;m sorry!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His hands by his mouth, Subaru resumed with a loud voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A call from the bottom of his heart, yet the absence of any response whatsoever from her made his heart stand a foot away from crumbling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With things remaining as is, pursuing Rem&#8217;s vanished form, he desperately darted his eyes around the dense trees of the forest&#8211;,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8212;-]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he once again widely opened his mouth seeking to call Rem&#8217;s name, something entered the vicinity of his field of vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a slight change peeking through the gaps of the dense trees beyond the fallen leaves. Seeing it move differently from grass swaying in the wind&#8211;,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Re&#8211;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the instant he embraced hope and turned towards that direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;The impact charging with tremendous velocity, captured Subaru&#8217;s chest from the immediate front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8211;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to shriek, his legs lost balance due to the impact, and Subaru&#8217;s body flew backwards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Gah&#8230;&#8230; wh, at&#8230;.. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His thoughts thrown into chaos by the impact from the gaps through the trees directly ahead which he had seen, he darted his eyes around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, upon thinking about the impact he had received, he immediately understood that it was an attack. Thus, before he could even get his thoughts straight, Subaru tried to leap away from that place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he failed to leap. Because&#8211;,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8211;Ah?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because, the thick arrow piercing through Subaru&#8217;s chest, had pinned him to the gigantic tree behind him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Guh, bhugh&#8230;.. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment he directed his awareness to it, he vomited blood overflowing through his throat at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stabbed through, massive quantities of blood from ruptured organs or otherwise flowed out, without cease. Vomiting blood instead of exhaling air, Subaru suffered whilst breathing once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst suffering, he grabbed the arrow in his chest and tried to pull it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He couldn&#8217;t, not in the slightest bit. The arrow had firmly pierced through both Subaru and the tree, disabling all movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was this arrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopeless, abnormal, a blow by a thick, mighty arrow. A truly tightly drawn bow, the body pierced by it was stitched and rendered immobile like a bug, only to flounder unsightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [Egh, raegh, eem, gh&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the gaps of the overflowing blood, he called the name of she who was yet in this forest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the call unable to vocalise words was charged with, was the evocation of caution towards the menace lurking in the forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wielding a bow and arrow, someone lurking in the forest had aimed for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, in this unseemly manner, unable to reach Rem, unable to accomplish anything, Subaru&#8211;,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subaru: [&#8211;m.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the hell is going on. Where is this place, what should he do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welling up fever and pain he took notice of after a delay, spread through his entire body, and blood streamed out of Subaru&#8217;s eyes, nose, and ears as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tasting the sensation of the disappearance of oneself and becoming empty, whilst feeling icy &#8220;Death&#8221; draw close to him, Subaru strained his eyes, made his throat tremble, and called her name until the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;Called her name, until the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smeared in blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the very end of the end, he called, called, kept calling her name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kept calling her name&#8211;,</span></p>

<p><b>Translation notes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1] &#8211; In the Japanese text, Rem is using the first person pronoun 私 instead of calling herself by her own name, Rem, which she did pre-amnesia.</span></p>

<p>Looks like Rem can make up for sleeping time in this Arc, meeting the Emperor that Julius mentioned. It was quite convenient for me he mentions this as I just finished reading the Extra special book that tells the story of Felix, Julius and Reinhard meeting the emperor.</p>

					<p>Thanks very much for the first chapter and all your translation work. That was very fast. Instead of reading I have been listening to your Arc 6 translations using Google assistant to read it out. I am going to try to read out your translations for anyone who might prefer to listen instead of reading sort of like an audiobook. This is just a casual project though so quality is iffy and I will make mistakes at the start a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/w3fDsmmijlE" rel="nofollow ugc">https://youtu.be/w3fDsmmijlE</a></p>

					<p>Wow, dead already. That didn&#8217;t take long.</p>
<p>Nice to see Emilia remaining level-headed in this situation. Seems like most of Subaru&#8217;s allies will be out of the story for a little while, but hopefully they manage to get a good cavalry rescue moment out of it.</p>
<p>I do wonder&#8230; If Rem woke up with amnesia, does that mean that what came back is her &#8216;Name&#8217;, and thus would the others remember her now? I&#8217;m somehow doubtful, since no-one mentioned it, but it kind of feel like that&#8217;s the way it should work, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s been a blast (almost) catching up to everything. Thanks to the translators for their good work!</p>

					<p>See this is why Emilia is better at the Waifu Wars (even if Patrache is best girl)</p>
<p>Rem is immediately violent against him because of her distrustful nature and his miasma. violent to the point of killing him (many times in Arc 2)</p>
<p>Emilia wouldn&#8217;t have done that even without her memories.</p>
<p>Also it&#8217;s kind of convenient that he doesn&#8217;t immediately explain some things to her so that she&#8217;d be less scared of him. Who she is, sister, legs, Louis, miasma e.t.c. but I&#8217;ll forgive it.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Subaru’s existence was a ticking time-bomb in itself&#8221;</p>
<p>Well said, Anastasia<br />
The if stories proves that statement to be true but Isn&#8217;t that more of a reason to be careful on your attitude towards him.</p>
<p>Subaru really is like a ticking time bomb,<br />
He is proven to be completely reliable as an ally but also a pretty troublesome enemy.</p>
